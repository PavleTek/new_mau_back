1: `npm install`
2: `node index.js`
3: open new terminal, `node initialPopulate.js`, this will create users "username: admin, password: admin", and "username: user, password: usrer"
which are needed since all funcitons require authentication
4: generators, raus, must be created through front end, since they need a central Id, RawData, needs a rau Id so it can be created through custom functions, exampmles might be found on testPrisma.js
